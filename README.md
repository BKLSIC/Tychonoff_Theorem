# Tychonoff's Theorem
The order, algebra and topology of the Bourbaki group are the foundation of modern mathematics. On the basis of the
proof assistant Coq, the formal system of these three major parental structures can be constructed completely. On the basis of the
formalization of axiomatic set theory, this work present the formal framework of general topology. This work completes the
formalization of some basic definitions of general topology, including base, subbase, topology, and compact space. In addition,
the formal proof of the Alexander subbase theorem is proposed on the basis of Tukey’s lemma. Finally we complete the formal
proof of Tychonoff’s theorem, which is famous in general topology.
